# Can Of Books

**Author**: Sunny Lee 
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Lab11 5/24 This project will demonstrate the usage of a full MERN stack. Our objective is to be able to log in through authorization from a third party source, then be able to render content specific to that user. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Lab11 5/24 First step setting up the backend process was to set a port and then import all the necassary dependancies. For Lab 11 the required imports or require's, were: cors, express, jwt or jasonWebToken, and the jwks-rsa
## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
Lab 11 5/24 The client will send a request and will be prompted by the third party Autho0, for authentication of user. Then that authentication will log into other sites that have the users credentials, which then the user will be authenticated, and will pass a token into    the content that they requested from the server. 

## Change Log

    #Lab11:# 
    -created server.js with imports from express, cors, jwt, jwks
    -assigned client with domain
    -enabled token retrieval 
    -enabled access as response

    Will use all strengths listed above to increase productivity flow of the project and make sure the project is being accomplished at set deadlines.
    #Sunny’s Response# 
    Will use strengths listed to seek alternate methods for solutions, and keep trying to find solutions even if it becomes hard to 
### In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
    #Q’s Response# 
    More of the technical aspect and will definitely need some guidance with coding aspect of the project 
    #Sunny’s Response# 
    I want to develop a more in depth understanding to technical processes  
## Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
    #Q’s response#
    Will have initial meetup before working on assigned tasks to make sure there are no blockers and will carry out tasks and will obtain assistance if required
    Will also try to work in remo class room together so communication is always available if required
    #Sunny’s Response# 
    Look at the Trello project board, and then determine the goals for the given day before diving into the code 
    Discuss potential problem areas as well as potential success areas 
    #Conflict Resolution#

    #Q’s Response# 
    Will have discussion of noticeable difference in task management and will discuss ways to find solutions

    We will have discussions and constant check ins to ensure the assigned workload is being done

    #Q’s Response#
    Will discuss with individual to make sure that load is shared equally 
    #Sunny’s Response# 
    Discussions are key to ensure that each person is taking on the assigned task that will be at least close to equal workload 
    If there is more work needing to be done on one side, both team members can concentrate in that area  
## How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
    #Q’s Response# 
    Will discuss before the beginning of the project to better grasp where an individual's knowledge is currently and will make adjustments if necessary.
    Will also know that instructors and TA’s are available if required for extra assistance. 
    #Sunny’s Response# 
    The approach would be to have check in points to discuss problem areas, to focus on that area to gain mutual understanding
